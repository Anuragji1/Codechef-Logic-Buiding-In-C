**Data Types**
-----------------
Statement 1) 
Lets look at some common data types found in programming problems for beginners

Integers

Integers are whole numbers that can be negative, zero or positive. Examples - 15, 0, -5
Float

A float will have a decimal place. Examples - 4.5, -2.778
Note that 4.0, -2.0 are also floats
Strings

Strings are a group of characters. Examples - abcde, CodeChef, START69
Note that C does not contain a string datatype we can declare a string using a char array.
Arrays

Arrays are used to store multiple variables or input types. Examples of arrays
Array containing 6 integers - [1 , 5, 7, 10, 15, 2]
Array containing 4 strings - ["abcd", "d", "ccc", "c123"]
NOTE - Array containing a combination of string and integers - ["abcd", 4, "ccc", 25] is not possible in C
Note that the strings in the array were denoted as "abcd" - we will come to this at a later stage
Bool

Bools are available under the header stdbool.h
They are used to obtain true or false output from the code

-------------
1. Integers:

Whole numbers (no decimals)
Can be negative, zero, or positive
Examples: 15, 0, -5
Typically used to store quantities or counts
2. Floats:

Numbers with decimal places
Represent real numbers
Examples: 4.5, -2.778, 4.0, -2.0
Used for calculations involving decimals or fractions
3. Strings:

Sequences of characters
Used to store text or words
Examples: "abcde", "CodeChef", "START69"
C doesn't have a built-in string data type, so they are represented using character arrays (char[])
4. Arrays:

Collections of multiple variables of the same data type
Accessed using indices (starting from 0)
Examples:
Array of integers: [1, 5, 7, 10, 15, 2]
Array of strings: ["abcd", "d", "ccc", "c123"]
C arrays cannot store mixed data types (e.g., strings and integers together)
5. Bools:

Represent Boolean values: true or false
Available in C by including the header file stdbool.h
Used for logical operations and decision-making in code
Key Points:

Data types are essential for defining the kind of data a variable can hold.
Choosing appropriate data types is crucial for efficient memory usage and accurate calculations.
C offers a variety of data types to accommodate different data needs.
Understanding data types is a fundamental concept in programming.
